'Maabara Mkononi' is a swahili word meaning 'Laboratory on hand', Maabara Mkononi is a project inspired by my initial profession which was a medical Laboratory technologist.

With this project I aim to simplify the availability and access to Medical laboratoey services by requesting(Booking) a test directly from the convenience of home, and a practitioner will come to collect the samples.

To install or run this project one has to First create an envvironment and install the requirements from the 'requirements.txt', there after he can deploy it.

I decided to create is as my portfolio project as a basic MVP but, I will leave it for future scalability.
